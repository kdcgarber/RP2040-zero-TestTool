# RP2040-zero-TestTool
This is used as a test harness for a RP2040-zero and connecting it to other I/O.
I needed a small tool to enable me to turn on or read any GPIO port.
I saw a cool version with a web interface that does more for a Raspberry Pi Pico W or any with wifi.  (https://github.com/sysprogs/PicoHTTPServer/)
This is an small attempt to give me a lot of those features with terminal output instead of a web interface,
So it lacks the polish, but is for me helpful testing small project.

This is just a test breadboard I used to validate the software to ensure I/O works in both directions and that the tool labels are configureable correctly.
